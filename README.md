Machine translation is an exciting field in deep learning, enabling computers to automatically convert text from one language to another. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll walk through the process of building a simple English-to-French translator using GRU. Weâ€™ll use Keras and TensorFlow to create a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). By the end, youâ€™ll know how to preprocess text data, build and train a neural network for translation, and use it to translate new sentences.

# Features





Translates simple English sentences to French.



Built with a seq2seq model using GRU layers.



Easy-to-understand code for beginners.

# Conclusion

While this model is rudimentary, itâ€™s a great starting point. To improve it, you could:

Use a larger dataset
Add an attention mechanism for better handling of long sentences
Tune hyperparameters like embedding size or GRU units
