# Simple English-to-French Translator
Machine translation is an exciting field in deep learning, enabling computers to automatically convert text from one language to another. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the process of building a simple English-to-French translator using GRU. We’ll use Keras and TensorFlow to create a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). By the end, you’ll know how to preprocess text data, build and train a neural network for translation, and use it to translate new sentences.

# Features





Translates simple English sentences to French.



Built with a seq2seq model using GRU layers.



Easy-to-understand code for beginners.

# Conclusion

While this model is rudimentary, it’s a great starting point. To improve it, you could:

Use a larger dataset
Add an attention mechanism for better handling of long sentences
Tune hyperparameters like embedding size or GRU units
